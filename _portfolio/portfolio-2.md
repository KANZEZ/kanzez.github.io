An obstacle course with fall, slope, terrain, and gap sections was set to showcase the motion capabilities and robustness of the soft robot. I designed a bionic cat tongue papillae structure and installed it on the robot's chassis to provide forward friction for locomotion on various surfaces. Then an origami-inspired leg with contraction and expansion was proposed to pass through the gap task. I wrote an embedded integrated control algorithm to realize robot gaits through sequent pneumatic actuation. I gradually realized the extraordinary athletic capacity performed by soft robots, and hence why they play an exclusive role in human performance enhancement, i.e., to gently convert mechanical force into organism motions.
