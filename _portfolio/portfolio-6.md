An obstacle course with fall, slope, terrain, and gap sections was set to showcase the motion capabilities and robustness of the soft robot. I designed a bionic cat tongue papillae structure and installed it on the robot's chassis to provide forward friction for locomotion on various surfaces. Then an origami-inspired leg with contraction and expansion was proposed to pass through the gap task. I wrote an embedded integrated control algorithm to realize robot gaits through sequent pneumatic actuation.
