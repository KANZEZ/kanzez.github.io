This course project uses A-star algorithm as the first stage to plan a collision-free path, and then Ramer–Douglas–Peucker(RDP) algorithm is used to filter out the unnessecery waypoints, a polynomial trajecotry based on minimum jerk trajectory generation method is generated to smooth the path and make sure the trajectory is dynamically feasible.
