Hey! my name is Songhao Huang (黄松昊). I’m a second-year master student at the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM), University of Pennsylvania. Currently, I do research at GRASP Lab. I received my Bachelor degree in Robotics Engineering at the Southern University of Science and Technology, China.
My research interests lie in the intersection of planning, control and learning, I’m deeply interested in (single / multi-agent / learning-enable) motion planning and control in the application of aerial/ground robotics.
